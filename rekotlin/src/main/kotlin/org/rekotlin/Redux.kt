 * A root store that can spawn child stores.
 *
 * Children can bootstrap from the root store without the root knowing the children at compile time.
 *
 * This is useful when an application is structured like a tree, with a single root module, that
 * owns shared state used by other features, for example in the diagram below
 *
 * ```
 * +---+ +---+ +---+
 * | F | | F | | F |
 * | e | | e | | e |
 * | a | | a | | a |
 * | t | | t | | t |
 * |   | |   | |   |
 * | 1 | | 2 | | 3 |
 * +---+ +---+ +---+
 * +---------------+
 * |     Root      |
 * +---------------+
 * ```
 *
 * Root, feature 1, feature 2 and feature 3 can be different gradle modules, with the features
 * depending on the root. If the root injects a [RootStore] into the feature modules, each feature
 * can use [RootStore.childStore] or [RootStore.plus] to create its own child store.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val rootStore: RootStore<RootState> = ... // dependency injection however you like
 * val featureStore: Store<Pair<RootState, FeatureState>> =
 *          rootStore.childStore(::childReducer, initialChildState)
 * // or shorthand (without initial state) you can use the `+` operator
 * val featureStore: Store<Pair<RootState, FeatureState>> = rootStore + ::childReducer
 * ```
 *
 * Any [Action] or [Effect] dispatched to a child will pass through the parent and all its children.
 * Any [Action] or [Effect] dispatched to the parent will pass trhough the parent and all its children.
 *
 * Subscribers to child stores only see the local view of root state + child state, not the global
 * application state.
 *
 * Subscribers to the root store only see the root state.
 *
 * A limitation of child stores is that they don't have their own middlewares. You have to
 * declare all [Middleware]s in the root store, all [Action]s passed to any of the stores (parent or
 * child) will pass through the root store's [Middleware]s before reaching any reducers.

 *
 * In addition to state the [Store] allows to dispatch and listen for [Effect]s.
 * [Effect]s are similar to [Action]s, but the key difference is that they do not trigger state
 * changes. They are intended to implement ephemeral events such a animations, snackbars, toasts etc.
 * To listen for [Effect]s implement [Listener] and [Store.subscribe] it.
 * To dispatch effects use [Store.dispatch].
 *
 * [Middleware]s can intercept all actions and change the application behavior fundamentally.
 * One such example is the Thunk middleware.
 *
 * To create a store use the [store] function.
